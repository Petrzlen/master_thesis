%Experimental Methodology â€“ in this section you should describe the environment where you did the experiments, tools you used (compilers, libraries, profilers, simulators) and benchmarks that you used. Here you should tell what is your evaluation criteria (e.g. Speedup) and metrics (e.g. throughput). Anything important that was made to conduct the experiments should be here (e.g. preparing traces for reproducing deterministic executions). If your experimental methodology has limitations you should mention them here (e.g. when using simulator you used small data input sets).
