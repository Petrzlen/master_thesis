%Experimental Methodology â€“ in this section you should describe the environment where you did the experiments, tools you used (compilers, libraries, profilers, simulators) and benchmarks that you used. Here you should tell what is your evaluation criteria (e.g. Speedup) and metrics (e.g. throughput). Anything important that was made to conduct the experiments should be here (e.g. preparing traces for reproducing deterministic executions). If your experimental methodology has limitations you should mention them here (e.g. when using simulator you used small data input sets).

\section{Simulations}
\label{sec:simulations} 

\subsection*{Introduction} 
In this section we describe all simulations which we performed in our work. We start with description of our modified versions of BAL \ref{sec:sim-our} and continue with description of experiments \ref{sec:sim-exp} used to prove or disprove our hypothesis. After that we shortly present datasets \ref{sec:sim-data} used for our simulations and end with evaluation metrics \ref{sec:sim-evaluation} used in the results section \ref{sec:results}.
