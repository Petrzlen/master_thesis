%Experimental Methodology â€“ in this section, you should describe the environment where you did the experiments, tools you used (compilers, libraries, profilers, simulators) and benchmarks that you used. Here you should tell what is your evaluation criteria (e.g. Speedup) and metrics (e.g. throughput). Anything important that was made to conduct the experiments should be here (e.g. preparing traces for reproducing deterministic executions). If your experimental methodology has limitations you should mention them here (e.g. when using simulator you used small data input sets).

\section{Simulations}
\label{sec:simulations} 

\subsection*{Introduction} 
In this section, we describe all simulations which we performed in our work. We start with definition of our evaluation metrics in Section~\ref{sec:sim-evaluation} and te we give a short description of datasets used for our simulations in Section~\ref{sec:sim-data}. The main part are the descriptions of used modified versions of BAL in Section~\ref{sec:sim-our}. Finally, we end with additional experiments used to prove or disprove our hypotheses in Section~\ref{sec:sim-exp}.
