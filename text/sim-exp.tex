\subsection{Experiments}
\label{sec:sim-exp} 

In this section, we describe modifications which could be applied to any model. Some of them, such as momentum~(\ref{sec:our-momentum}) and batch learning mode~(\ref{sec:our-batch-mode}) are well--known approaches. Other, such as dynamic learning rates~(\ref{sec:our-dynamic-lambda}) or weight initialization classification~(\ref{sec:our-weight-init-class}) were chosen specially for BAL to reinforce important features.
