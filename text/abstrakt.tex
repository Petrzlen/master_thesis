%Abstract is very important part of the thesis. It will be most read by people and should be written with a great care. The abstract should mention:
% 1) About the problem you want to solve
% 2) About your solution – how you solve the problem
% 3) Highlights about how good is your solution (e.g. achieves 70\% better performance) referring to the results you obtained in your experiments (e.g. achieves 70\% better performance).
% 4) Possible impacts of your work into the field (e.g. “The proposed solution can be used to offload the CPU by executing data parallel computation intensive code on GPUs and thus obtaining additional Speedup for no cost”).
