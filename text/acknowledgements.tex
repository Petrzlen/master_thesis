\subsection*{Acknowledgements}

The completion of this thesis could not have been possible without my supervisor Igor Farkaš who encouraged and helped me out through the whole process. Especially, I want to thank him for investing his precious time in our weekly sessions which navigated me what to do next and made me work regularly. 

I also want to thank my parents Viktor and Jarmila for their lifelong investment in providing me with the best education they could, while often sacrifing their own comfort.
