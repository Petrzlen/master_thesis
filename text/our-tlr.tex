We proposed the \emph{Two learning rate (TLR)} model as a solution for the \emph{hidden activation settling} \ref{sec:our-hidden-activation} based on the Dynamic lambda model \ref{sec:our-dynamic-lambda}. As the name suggests this model uses two learning rates. First learning rate~$\lambda_v$, i.e.~\emph{lambda visible}, for weights~$W^{HI}$ and~$W^{HO}$ and second learning rate $\lambda_h$, i.e.~\emph{lambda hidden}, for weights~$W^{IH}$ and~$W^{OH}$. Both~$\lambda_v$ and~$\lambda_h$ are constant for the whole learning phase and therefore this model is consistent with our biological plausibility assumptions. Note that the names are derived from where they contribute in the post--synaptic activation. 

Our simulations show that setting $\lambda_v \cdot \lambda_h \approx 1$ and $\lambda_v \ll \lambda_h$ could lead to significantly better performance in comparison to the standard BAL model \ref{sec:results-tlr}. Our intuition explains it as follows: because $\lambda_v \ll 1$ thus $W^{IH}$ and $W^{OH}$ are updated only little and also activations $h^{\rm F}$ and $h^{\rm B}$ change only a little and $|h^{\rm F}- h^{\rm B}|$ converges to zero slower. Thus error terms $(y_j^{\rm B} - y_j^{\rm F})$ and $(x_j^{\rm F} - x_j^{\rm B})$ from the BAL learning rule \ref{eq:models-bal-learning-rule-forward} for $W^{HI}$ and $W^{HO}$ impact the weight change longer with {\bf non}--\emph{constant hidden activations} \ref{sec:our-hidden-activation}. 

Moreover we can explain TLR in terms of bio-plausibility. The perception of visible input to internal hidden representation is changed only little over time while the reconstruction to target pattern from these internal representation is trained hard.
