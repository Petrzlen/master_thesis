%Experimental Results and Analysis – in this section you should show the quantitative results – charts and tables. Analyze the results by explaining and highlighting what is important on them in terms of your goals and what is bad. You should explain the strange results too.

\section{Results and Analysis of Two learning rate model} %TODO better section name 
\label{sec:results} 

In this section we present and analyse our most important result, i.e. the \emph{Two learning rate} model \ref{sec:our-two-lambdas}. Other results are shortly discussed in the appendix \ref{sec:appendix-results}. We start by comparing it to previous models \ref{sec:results-comparison}
