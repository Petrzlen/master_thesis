%11.   State of the Art (or Related Work or Literature Review)
%In this section you should present the theoretical basis of your work and overview of the existing solutions. When discussing on the exiting solutions you should relate and qualitatively compare them with yours. This chapter should contain:

% 1) The theory and concepts of your work. For example, if you work on compiler you can mention about how compiler works without getting much into detail.

% 2) Existing state of the art solution. For example, if you implement an optimization pass, you should mention about existing optimization passes that are relevant with yours. You should emphasize the commons and differences with your solution and with the existing ones.

% You may divide this chapter in sections (e.g. each for the different existing solution).

%TODO more search - I could miss a lot (see articles which reference O'Reilly 96 ..) 
%TODO more references
%TODO made up a template for each model, like 1. motivation 2. activation table 3. learning rule
%TODO write it as a comparison to BAL-like models we analysed 

In this section we briefly mention models on which our work was based on. Mainly it's the Bidirectional Activation-based Learning algorithm \ref{sec:models-bal} by \citet{farkas2013bal} and the Generalized recirculation \ref{sec:models-generec} by \citet{o1996bio}. The other two models are inspiration for the two former ones. Understanding the latter helps understanding the former.
