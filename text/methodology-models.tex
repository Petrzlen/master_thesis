\subsection{Models}

\subsubsection{Previous} 

\begin{itemize} 
\item Contrastive Hebbian Learning
\item GeneRec 
\item Bidirectional Activation-based Learning algorithm
\end{itemize}  

\subsubsection{Candidate selection} 
Hidden distance (over 70\%) over in triangle (68.3 \%).

\subsubsection{Long training} 
even after 800,000 epochs there are some networks for which the error change

\subsubsection{Other} 
\begin{itemize} 
\item Momentum
\item Weight initialization 
\item Dynamic weight lambda (no change after few tries TODO test again) 
\item Batch mode (i.e. no shuffle and therefore deterministic)
\item Multilayer GeneRec - 42\% on handwritten digit recognition 
\item Dropout TODO (5\%,10\%,20\%,50\% chances)
\item Presenting in-out on which it has errors (based on rerun shuffle data) - worked. 
\item TODO Noise 
\item Ensemble -> should work as we have over 50\% success
\end{itemize}
