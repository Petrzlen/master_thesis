\subsection{Models}

\subsubsection*{Introduction} 
TODO rewrite  
In this section we describe our versions of BAL for which we ran experiments. We examined several common neural network modifications such as adding \emph{momentum} or learning in \emph{batch mode}. We also examined novel approaches to our knowledge such. In general onle few variants of the original BAL model were successful as we will see in the following chapter. 

%We ignored existing models which are trained non-locally such as: 
%\begin{itemize} 
%\item Training feedforward networks with the Marquardt algorithm
%\item Extreme learning machine: a new learning scheme of feedforward neural networks
%\end{itemize} 
%Although the learning rate could be significantly better compared to traditional BP or our BAL.
