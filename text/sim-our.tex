\subsection{New models}
\label{sec:sim-our} 

\subsubsection*{Introduction} 
In this section we describe models we developed based on BAL \ref{sec:models-bal}. We start with description of \emph{TLR} \ref{sec:our-tlr} as the most important model of our work and continue with description of \emph{BAL-recirc} which is a combinations both of BAL and GeneRec \ref{sec:models-generec}. Both models are inspired by our experiments further described in \ref{sec:sim-exp}.
